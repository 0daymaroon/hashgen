H3ll0 fri3nd, i am new to github and this is my first project which is an offline hash generator capable of generating md5,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha384 and sha512 hashes. I have created it in python3 using hashlib library.
Thus first install python3 in your system.Their are 4 files here, hashgenlinux,hashgenwindows and their respective codes.

To run in Windows--

1) Directly double click on the hashgenwindows.py file and it will open up in your python3 console.
2) You can also open up this script in your windows command shell or windows powershell.  Just open the command shell (Windows->cmd) or Powershell (Shift+rightclick hold ->open powershell) and go to the path where you downloaded the file, then type "py hashgenwindows.py" to start it.


To run in Linux--

1)Open the terminal, go to the path and type "python3 ./hashgenlinux.py"



Thanks!
